MKDoc::Authz - Authorization module for MKDoc::Core
===================================================

MKDoc::Authz is a powerful authorization module for the MKDoc::Core framework.

Using access control lists, it lets you define sets of permissions (called
'groups') and then associate users with those groups.

This framework is a step further in our great 'open-source MKDoc as a bunch of
independant modules' plan.
